# Formula-SAE-Chassis-Structural-Analysis
Performed FEA of a Formula SAE chassis using ANSYS Workbench to assess stiffness and strength under torsion, cornering, aero, and impact loads. Modeled tubular beam frame, defined joints, applied realistic loads, and verified stresses within limits for optimized structural performance.
